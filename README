# ABOUT
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A module is used to recurse directory structures and saving the data
into an array.
You can give it certain regex rules (e.g. '\.gif$' will match only *.gif files)
and you can make it check for a '.ignore_index' file in that directory
to make it ignore.

File::Recurse has pod documentation that gives a more complete overview, but
in a nutshell:

NOTE: perldoc File::Recurse to find out about the rules that you can have

Here is an example program that would output all the files in directories
starting from /tmp that have a period somewhere in the name,
and isn't a .gif file

use File::Recurse;

my %files = &Recurse(['/tmp'], {match => '\.', nomatch => '\.html$'});

foreach (sort keys %files) {
   print "Dir$_\n";
   foreach (@{ $files{$_} }) {
    print " File: $_\n";
   }
}

# PROBLEMS/BUG REPORTS
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please send any reports of problems or bugs to dion@member.com. I wouldn't
mind a short note to know that you're using this, just so I can justify its
continued development to my manager :-). (In seriousness, a rough idea of
how many others are using this will help promote its upkeep.)
